# Company Test Project
Project Developed for the test of the e-core company.

### Approched

The project domain consists only of Role management.
The list of users and teams is originated by an external service that is accessed 
via FeignClient at project startup time. Then, all existing relationships between members and teams necessary for role management are created.

### Running documentation locally
1. Open terminal and execute "./run.sh"

### Future Improvements
Implement contract to update users and teams
